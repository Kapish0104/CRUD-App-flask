# CRUD-App-flask
Here is an Interesting flask app with a UI that demonstrates all the Create, Update, Read and delete operations. 

It uses sql as a database.

The app takes a CSV file, a sample of which is provided here and then displays all the contents of that file on the UI for user to interact with.

One can edit any details in those entries. To add image, just make sure the name of that image matches to the one mentioned in the CSV. Image will be automatically updated on the respective Entry.
